      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        This project involved a responsive redesign of the Avon Cinema website. The original site had outdated styling, was not mobile-friendly, and had inconsistent structure across breakpoints. My goal was to reimagine the site while preserving its nostalgic cinema feel.

      <h2>Before & After</h2>
      <div class="image-row">
        <div class="image-col">
          <div class="screenshot">
            <h3>Original (Desktop View)</h3>
            <img src="./assets/original_large.png" alt="After - Tablet" class="clickable-img"/>
          </div>
          <p>Irresponsiveness lead to huge blank space on large devices. The navigation bar is cluttered and hard to read due to the condensed spacing and small font size. </p>

            <h3>Redesign (Desktop View)</h3>
            <img src="./assets/new_large.png" alt="After - Desktop" class="clickable-img"/>
          </div>
          <p>Introduced flexible spacing, modern hover effects, and a cleaner font. The navigation is now responsive and centers well on all screen sizes, improving readability and accessibility.</p>

            <img src="./assets/original_tablet.png" alt="After - Tablet" class="clickable-img"/>
          </div>
          <p>Text alignment is inconsistent, and there’s no clear grouping of information. The layout feels cramped, making it difficult to distinguish between categories like ticket prices and policies.</p>

            <h3>Redesign (Tablet View)</h3>
            <img src="./assets/new_tablet.png" alt="After - Desktop" class="clickable-img"/>
          </div>
          <p>Separated pricing details into columns with consistent spacing and center-aligned them for clarity. T he motif imagery creates visual breaks to guide the user through the page.</p>

            <img src="./assets/original_mobile.png" alt="Before - Mobile" class="clickable-img"/>
          </div>
          <p>Information is packed tightly into columns with no spacing, especailly the top navigation bar. The typography lacks contrast, and the layout doesn’t adapt to screen size.</p>

            <img src="./assets/new_mobile.png" alt="After - Mobile" class="clickable-img"/>
          </div>
          <p>Added left navigation bar and visual padding to make directions and contact info scannable. Subsections collapses into a stacked format that’s easy to read.</p>

      <h2>Reflection</h2>
      <p>
        Working on this redesign helped sharpen my responsive design skills. One of the main challenges was balancing 
        aesthetics with functionality across different breakpoints—especially making sure the layout worked well on 
        both mobile and tablet without cluttering the screen. I encountered specific issues with layout shifts, 
        like handling the motif row duplication and ensuring the image counts stayed consistent across sections. 
        I also practiced modularizing code to handle layout issues and improve readability.
